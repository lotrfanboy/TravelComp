After the user clicks “Calcular Viagem”, the trip is created and they’re redirected to a Trip Detail view. Please implement the following UI and interactions:

1. Page Layout
Two-column responsive layout:

Left column (30–40% width): Interactive trip summary

Right column (60–70% width): Map view with POIs

On mobile, stack columns vertically (summary first, then map).

2. Left Column: Interactive Summary
Trip Header

Trip name, dates, number of travelers

“Edit Trip” button linking back to the wizard in edit mode

Destination Details

Show origin → destination path

Display the selected dates next to each (e.g. “São Paulo → Paris (05/06–12/06)”)

Cost Breakdown

Flight Options (list of cards):

Airline logo, departure/arrival times, price

“Select” button on each card

Hotel Options (list of cards):

Hotel name, star rating, nightly rate, image thumbnail

“Select” button on each card

Totals & Actions

Show running total as the user selects flight + hotel

Final “Confirm & Save” button (primary style)

All lists should load from your backend cost-simulation endpoints. Show a loading indicator while fetching.

3. Right Column: Map with Points of Interest
Embed a map (Leaflet, Google Maps, or similar) centered on the destination.

Plot markers for the top 5 POIs chosen earlier (with icons).

Clicking a marker shows a small popup with the POI name and image.

Below the map, optionally list the POIs with “View on Map” links.

4. Data & Integration
The detail page receives from backend:

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "trip": { /* trip data */ },
  "flightOptions": [ /* ... */ ],
  "hotelOptions": [ /* ... */ ],
  "pointsOfInterest": [ /* name, coords, imageUrl */ ]
}
Use these arrays to render cards and map markers.

5. Visual & Interaction Notes
Consistent styling with your app’s palette and typography.

Cards: rounded, shadowed, hover lift.

Map and summary should remain in sync as user picks options.

Ensure mobile responsiveness and smooth loading states.
